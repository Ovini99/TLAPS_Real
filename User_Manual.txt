User Manual of TLA+ Proof Manager (tlapm)
=========================================

TLA+ specifications containing examples of real arithmetic can be found in the 
${prefix}/lib/tlaps/examples/real_num_examples folder 
(${prefix} is the directory in which tlapm is installed)

Running tlapm via the TLA+ toolbox
==================================
Prior to running tlapm via the toolbox IDE you need to add the location of TLAPS.tla file to
the list of libraries used by the Toolbox by opening the Toolbox and going to 
"File > Preferences > TLA+ Preferences" and add the directory where TLAPS.tla is located to the 
list of library path locations i.e. ${prefix}/lib/tlaps/

The location the tlapm should be set via "File > Preferences > TLAPS" and add in
the location of the tlapm created during installation i.e. ${prefix}/bin/tlapm

The toolbox enables proving theorems one at a time. In order to prove a theorem right-click the theorem to be proved 
and follow "TLA Proof Manager > Launch Prover...", if the theorem is highlighted green as a result 
the theorem has been proved successfully, if the theorem is highlighted red then the theorem failed to be proved.
If the theorem is highlighted red an additional window appears providing user an indication of the theorem 
that failed to be proved and the resultant backend error.

Running tlapm via the command-line terminal
===========================================
To run tlapm via the command-line terminal change the current directory to the location of the bin folder 
which was created during installation (${prefix}/bin) 
and run the following command to run tlapm

./tlapm <options> FILE 

where ./tlapm would invoke the tlapm binary executable file and FILE is replaced by
the filepath containing the TLA+ specifications containing the theorems to be proved. 
The <options> represents additional arguments to passed
(available arguments can be found by ./tlapm --help command)

As an example, to prove the theorem contained in TLA+ specification
RealNumExample1.tla we run the following command

./tlapm --cleanfp ../lib/tlaps/examples/real_num_examples/RealNumExample1.tla

where we include the option --cleanfp to erase any fingerprint files which were created 
during previous proving of theorems in the same file.
The location of RealNumExample1.tla is given as a relative path to the tlapm executable

If the theorem is proved successfully then the following output result is produced

[INFO] All x obligations proved.

otherwise the following error output result is produced

[ERROR] Could not prove or check 
[ERROR] x/y obligations failed.
