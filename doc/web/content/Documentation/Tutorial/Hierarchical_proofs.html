  <h2>Hierarchical proofs</h2>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>Our proof requires the following properties of GCDs, which for
    simplicity we just assume:</p>

  <div lines="AXIOM GCDProperty1 ==/1-3"></div>

  <h3>Known and usable facts</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>At any point in a TLA+ proof, there is a current obligation that
    is to be proved.  The obligation contains
    a <span style="font-style:italic">context</span> of
    <span style="font-style:italic">known</span> facts, definitions,
    and declarations, and a <span style="font-style:italic">goal</span>.
    The obligation claims that the goal is logically entailed by the
    context. Some of the facts and definitions in the context are
    marked as <span style="font-style:italic">usable</span> for
    reasoning, while the remaining facts and definitions
    are <span style="font-style:italic">hidden</span>. That obligation
    is then sent to a backend
    (<a href="http://zenon-prover.org">Zenon</a>,
    <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>,
    SMT solvers &ndash; see the <a href="Tactics.html">tactics
    section</a>) that tries to prove it. The smaller the context is,
    the faster those backends are. Hence TLAPS tries to keep that
    context as small as possible. For example,
    the axioms about GCD stated above are not
    directly usable by the backends: they
    are <span style="font-style:italic">known</span>
    but <span style="font-style:italic">not usable</span>. As we have
    seen in the <a href="A_simple_proof.html">simple proof
    section</a>, you have to explicitly <tla>USE</tla>
    or <span style="font-style:italic">cite</span> a fact in order for it
    to be included in the context of the obligation sent to backends.
    As an exception to this rule,
    <span style="font-style:italic">domain facts</span> of the form
    <tla>x \in S</tla> are always usable in a proof. (Such assumptions are
    typically introduced in an <tla>ASSUME &hellip; PROVE</tla>
    construct, most frequently in the form of an assumption
    <tla>NEW x \in X</tla>.)
    Moreover, <span style="font-style:italic">unnamed</span>
    proof steps (see below) are aways usable. The other known facts
    are hidden by default.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:30px">Let us get back to our example. Now that
  we have proved that the initial state satisfies the invariant, let
  us prove that this invariant is preserved by the next-state
  relation <tla>Next</tla></p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty =="></div>

  <h3>SUFFICES</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>Let us first simplify the goal to be proved by using
    a <tla>SUFFICES</tla> construct:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/1-3"></div>

  <p>This step asserts that it is sufficient to
    prove <tla>InductiveInvariant'</tla> while
    assuming <tla>InductiveInvariant</tla> and <tla>Next</tla>.
    Because the step is unnamed,
    both facts <tla>InductiveInvariant</tla>
    and <tla>Next</tla> are also made usable for the remainder of the
    proof. For more information about <tla>SUFFICES</tla>, see
    the section about <a href="Other_proof_constructs.html">other proof
    constructs</a>.</p>

  <h3>USE</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p> We'll need the definitions of <tla>InductiveInvariant</tla>
    and <tla>Next</tla> to be usable in the entire body of the
    proof. Hence, rather than making them usable with
    a <tla>BY DEF</tla> construct in each
    step, we can make them usable for all proof steps by using
    the <tla>USE DEF</tla> construct once,
    at the beginning of the proof:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/1-3,5"></div>

  <p>The general form of a <tla>USE</tla> step is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><tla>USE <em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>e</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> DEF <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>d</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></tla></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>which asserts that the definitions <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>,
    &hellip; <em>d</em><sub>n</sub> are to be made usable, and the
    facts <em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>e</em><sub>m</sub> are
    to be checked and then added to the context as usable. When checking
    these facts, all other known facts are temporarily considered to be
    usable, so it is possible to say <tla>USE e /\ f</tla>
    when <tla>e</tla> and <tla>f</tla> are in the context but
    hidden. Observe that the <tla>USE</tla>
    directive is syntactically similar to <tla>BY</tla>,
    but it obviously does not check if the current assertion
    follows from the cited facts.</p>

  <h3>The QED step</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>To prove the theorem <tla>NextProperty</tla>, we have to reason by cases,
    and prove that <tla>InductiveInvariant'</tla> is true when one of
    the actions of <tla>Next</tla> is performed (i.e. when <tla>x
      &lt; y</tla> and also when <tla>x &gt; y</tla>). Let us write
    this outer level of the hierarchical proof:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/1-3,5-6,8,13,20-21"></div>

  <p><tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla>, <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>, <tla>&lt;1&gt;b</tla>
     and <tla>&lt;1&gt;2</tla> are <em>step names</em>
     (the <tla>&lt;1&gt;</tla> part of the step name indicates the
     step's <em>level</em>, which is 1. The proof itself consists of
     four claims named by these step names (plus the two first unnamed
     steps); the first three are unjustified, while the last is
     justified by the cited
     facts <tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla>, <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>
     and <tla>&lt;1&gt;b</tla>. The <tla>QED</tla>
     step asserts the main goal of the theorem. Let us verify that it
     can be proved from
     steps <tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla>, <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>
     and <tla>&lt;1&gt;b</tla>:</p>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/qed.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/qeds.png"/>
          </a>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p> After having asked TLAPS to prove the theorem,
    the <tla>QED</tla> step gets colored
    green. This means that facts mentioned by
    steps <tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla>, <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>
    and <tla>&lt;1&gt;b</tla> are sufficient to prove the theorem. But
    as you can see, those proof steps are colored yellow, which means
    that their proofs are omitted.  (The Toolbox allows you to change
    what colors are used to indicate the proof status of a step, and
    also what proof statuses are displayed.)  Let us now prove these
    proof steps.</p>

  <h3>Non-QED steps</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p> First, the proofs of
    the <tla>SUFFICES</tla> step and
    step <tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla> are obvious as you can see in the
    following screenshot. In particular, step <tla>&lt;1&gt;1</tla>
    follows from the usable fact <tla>Next</tla> introduced in
    the unnamed <tla>SUFFICES</span></tla> step
    and the definition of <tla>Next</tla>, which is also usable.
  </p>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ops2.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ops2s.png" />
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Let us now prove step <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>. We subdivide this proof
    into two steps of level 2. The first step asserts that
    <tla>y - x \in Number</tla> and that <tla>y</tla>
    is not less than <tla>x</tla>. The second,
    <tla>QED</span></tla> step proves
    the main goal from the case assumption of step <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla>,
    the just established step <tla>&lt;2&gt;1</tla>, and axiom
    <tla>GCDProperty3</tla>.</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/1-9,11-13,20-21"></div>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ops3.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ops3s.png" />
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p> Let us now prove
    step <tla>&lt;2&gt;1</tla>. We have to use
    the case assumption <tla>&lt;1&gt;a</tla> and make
    the definition of <tla>Number</tla> usable:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/9-10"></div>

  <p>The proof of the <tla>y &lt; x</tla> case is quite similar:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM NextProperty ==/13-19"></div>

  <p>Then theorem <tla>NextProperty</tla> is proved by TLAPS:</p>
  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ops6.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ops6s.png" />
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h3>Wrapping up the proof</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>Now we have <tla>InitProperty</tla>
  and <tla>NextProperty</tla>, we can prove the main theorem.</p>

  <p>First we prove that a stuttering step (i.e. a step that leaves
  all variables unchanged) keeps the invariant unchanged. This is
  proved simply by checking that the definition
  of <tla>InductiveInvariant</tla> involves no
  variables other than <tla>x</tla> and <tla>y</tla>:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM Correctness ==/1-3"></div>

  <p>Then we can prove that any process that follows the specification
  must keep <tla>InductiveInvariant</tla> true at all times, by
  using the previous step and the <tla>InitProperty</tla>
  and <tla>NextProperty</tla> theorems:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM Correctness ==/7-8"></div>

  <p> Unfortunately, that doesn't work:</p>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ops4.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ops4s.png" />
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p> Indeed, none of the default back-end provers (SMT, Zenon, and
    Isabelle) can deal with temporal logic. But TLAPS includes an
    interface to a propositional temporal logic prover (LS4), which
    can be invoked by adding <tla>PTL</tla> to the set of usable facts.
    Since <tla>PTL</tla> is defined in the <code>TLAPS.tla</code>
    standard module, we have to explicitly extend the TLAPS module:</p>

  <div lines="----/1-2"></div>

  <p>Then we can use the <tla>PTL</tla> backend to prove
  step <tla>&lt;1&gt;2</tla>:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM Correctness ==/4-5"></div>

<div class="bg">
  <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
    <tr><td>
        <a href="screenshots/ops5.png">
          <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ops5s.png"/>
        </a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

  <p>Finally we prove that, at any point in time, our invariant
  entails the correctness of the result, then use that to prove the
  main theorem:</p>

  <div lines="THEOREM Correctness ==/10-13"></div>

  <p>And this concludes the proof of correctness of Euclid's algorithm.</p>
