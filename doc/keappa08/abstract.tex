\begin{abstract}
  We describe an extension to the \tlaplus{} specification language
  with constructs for writing proofs and a proof environment, called
  the Proof Manager (PM), that checks those proofs.  The language and
  the \PM\ support the incremental development and checking of
  hierarchically structured proofs.  The \PM\ translates a proof into
  a set of independent proof obligations and calls upon a collection
  of back-end provers to verify them.  Different provers can be used
  to verify different obligations.  The currently supported back-ends
  are the tableau prover Zenon and Isabelle/\tlaplus{}, an
  axiomatisation of \tlaplus\ in Isabelle/Pure.  Isabelle/\tlaplus{}
  can also certify the correctness of a complete proof.
