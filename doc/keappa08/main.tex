% \llnote{We have been inconsistent about what we call the prover.  
%
% \ednote{SM}{Indeed, we should be consistent. However, remember that
%   the proofs found by the back-end(s) are in turn supposed to be
%   checked by Isabelle, so ``checker'' may be a bit confusing.}
%
% \ednote{DD}{This has been resolved: we have ``back-end provers''
% (Zenon and Isabelle tactics, later also haRVey) that ``verify'' proof
% obligations, and a ``certifier'' (Isabelle/TLA+) that ``certifies''
% their output} 
% I have found some places where the proper notation is still not
% being used.  I corrected all that I found, but I probably missed
% some.  Please check.\\[.3em]
% I also discovered that we have been writing ``\PM'' when we mean the
% system consisting of the \PM\ together with its back-end provers.
% (For example, we talk about the \PM\ checking a proof.)  I have used
% the term ``proof system'' to mean the \PM\ plus the back-end provers,
% and have introduced it where necessary.  But I've probably missed
% some places.

% \llnote{We should submit the paper with a table of contents.  A table of
% contents helps the reader.  It is traditionally omitted from 
% articles in journals and proceedings because it was hard to make
% them when the journal or proceedings was typeset separately from
% the typesetting of the individual articles.  It is stupid to omit
% a table of contents in an article that is not part of a journal
% or proceedings---even if it's a preprint of an article that will appear
% in one.  The same goes for a date.\\[.3em]
% In our case, creating this separate, unnumbered page also effectively
% excludes the abstract from the 10-page limit.
% }

\ednote{KC}{I moved the TOC to the end of the paper (in non-draft mode
  only). It is the French style, and it moreover allows all
  supplemental material to be numbered differently. I am not a huge
  fan of arguing with the PC about page limits. The paper without
  ednotes as of this commit fits snugly in 10 pages.
\llnote{And what happened to the statement saying that the appendix is
for the reviewers use, and we are not committed to including it in the
final version?}
